# DistractLess
A small program meant to keep you focused by closing websites and programs matching different set of rules regarding their window/tab name and URL

NOT finished by any means. 
First version is operational. 
Documentation is in the works, but won't be published for some time, because I have more important things to do right now.



# Fundamentals

DistractLess is a program designed to shut down distracting programs and browser tabs as soon as they gain focus.
